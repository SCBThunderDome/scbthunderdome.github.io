   Same shape as the league-data.js in the NCAA Legends repo, which
   this site's engine was copied from. script.js and style.css are
   shared from the repo root and need no changes.

   Split of duties:
     league-data.js    who's in the league, what week it is, the poll
     schedule-data.js  each team's schedule + scores
   ============================================================ */

/* ------------------------------------------------------------
   SEASON STATE — manually advanced, never date-driven.

   currentWeek is "PRESEASON" until Week 0 kicks off in-game, then
   the week number (0-15) currently being played.

   Week 1, confirmed by Josh 2026-07-30. Week 0 had exactly one
   game — Virginia 33, NC State 14 — and the rest of the league was
   on a bye. The schedule screenshots were taken before that result
   posted, which is why every team header in them still reads
   0-0 (0-0); the score is recorded in schedule-data.js regardless.

   THE ADVANCE DEADLINE is the only real-world date on the site, and
   it's stored twice — but only one of the two is authored:

     nextAdvanceAt  the real value, an ISO timestamp with an
                    explicit Eastern offset
     nextAdvance    the sentence coaches read, GENERATED from it

   The admin page and advance.js write the pair together, so don't
   hand-edit either one. If they ever disagree, nextAdvanceAt is
   right and the next advance will correct the text.

   The timestamp exists because free text can't be computed with,
   and the advance-day heads-up (tools/heads-up.js) has to answer
   "is the advance today?" every morning before it decides whether
   to post next week's H2H matchups. /deadline.js does the
   conversion both ways and explains the Eastern rule.

   Both blank hides the countdown line entirely rather than showing
   a stale deadline — better than a guess until the commissioner
   sets one.

   COACHES — from the sign-up sheet, snapshot 2026-07-30.

   NAMES are the first names used on the sign-up sheet. If coaches
   would rather appear as their gamertags, change `name` here — it
   is also the key `tools/config.json` matches Discord IDs on, so
   the two must agree (matching is case-insensitive).

   DISCORD IDs ARE DELIBERATELY NOT IN THIS FILE. GitHub Pages
   serves it publicly. They live only in tools/config.json, which is
   gitignored, and reach GitHub Actions through the DISCORD_CONFIG
   secret. Same split the NCAA Legends repo uses.

   CONFERENCES are as given on the sign-up sheet (ACC / SEC / XII /
   B1G / AAC) and match real-world alignment — unlike the NCAA
   Legends leagues, this one appears not to use custom realignment.

   espnId values marked UNVERIFIED below are best-guess and have not
   been eyeballed yet. Open /logo-check.html to check them all at
   once: a wrong id silently renders another school's logo, while a
   missing one falls back harmlessly to the monogram chip.

   COLORS are the primary school colour, lifted from the verified
   NCAA Legends entries where the same school appears there.
